NodeJS is a runtime environment on a V8 engine for executing JavaScript code with some additional functionality that allows the development of fast and scalable web applications but we canâ€™t run the Node.js application locally after closing the terminal or Application, to run the nodeJS application permanently. We use  NPM modules such as forever or PM2 to ensure that a given script runs continuously. NPM is a Default Package manager for Node.js Which enables us to access a lot of packages or modules that make things a lot easier for developing a web application.

Method 1: 

Using PM2 module:

Installing module in project Directory:
npm install pm2 -g
Start Your Node.js Application by pm2.
pm2 start [Your fileName]
All processes listed up which are registered with pm2.
pm2 list
Console output:

We can also stop any process runs by pm2 stop command:
 pm2 stop all                  
 pm2 stop [id number]       
Method 2: 

Using forever module

Installing module in your project Directory:
npm install forever -g
Start Your Node.js Application by forever module. 
forever start [Your FileName]
All processes listed up which are registered with forever
forever list
Console output:

 We can also remove or stop any processes that are registered with forever using index (such as 0 in this case)              
forever stopall
forever stop [index]
So now your Application will be running permanently even after exiting the terminal or Application.
